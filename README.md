# Ethernet Sniffer

by Caitlin Cowden, Shaughan Gladden, and Brian Rieder

Ethernet sniffer and packet flagger designed for tandem Cyclone V FPGA and Atom microprocessor on the Terasic DE2i-150 Rev. C board

Only the source files for the project will be uploaded here. In order to run this on the board, some variant of Questa and Altera Quartus II (Version 15.0.0 was used for development) will be required.

/Note:/ This project utilizes Altera IP (MAC and PLL) and will not be resynthesizable without the proper license for that IP.
